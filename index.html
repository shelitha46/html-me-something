                  <p>One of my favorite things to do is dream. I am a vivid dreamer and remember almost every detail of most of my dreams. I can remember colors and smells in my dreams and I can also remember the textures of things that I have felt in my dreams.  I look forward to going to sleep in anticipation of drifting into a dream good or bad. I believe that all of them have a purpose which is why I have been journaling my dreams for over twenty years.</p>

                <figcaption><b>A performance at the Touhill Performing Arts Center at UMSL</b></figcaption>
                <p>I enjoy playing the piano and giving piano lessons. I'm a classically trained pianist and have been playing for over 30 years. Earlier in my life, I was a piano performance major at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.  One day a person said to me, "Why are you majoring in piano performance?" "You do not need a degree to perform, if you are good, you will perform." After that conversation I left school, went home and started majoring in Business. Although I am not pursuing a career in music, I continue to play and teach.</p>
